# Centralized documentation

The docs/ folders is where we intend to centralized documentation to be placed. This folder should only contain the docs/img/ folder with images in it as well as markdown files with documentation for the various pieces of code stored within this repository. The images in the docs/img/ folder can be used in your markdown documents. Image filenames should be: **project-name-image-name**. This will make it easier to find images specifically related to a given project.

<!--- If there is a longer process involved in getting our documentation uploaded, this is the place where we should describe it--->
